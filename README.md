# AirMood: Your Personal Voice-Powered Air Quality & Weather Assistant

**AirMood** is an interactive web application that reimagines how people experience weather and air quality forecasts, putting health and accessibility at the center. Built for the NASA Space Apps Challenge, AirMood fuses real-time meteorological data, advanced air quality insights, and the power of voice interaction to help users make better, safer decisions‚Äîwherever they are.

## üöÄ Challenge Context

This project is a submission for the NASA Space Apps Challenge and directly addresses the [TEMPO Mission Challenge](https://www.nasa.gov/tempo/):

> **"Build a web-based app that forecasts air quality by integrating real-time TEMPO data with ground-based air quality measurements and weather data, notifying users of poor air quality, and helping to improve public health decisions."**

TEMPO (Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution) is revolutionizing air quality monitoring in North America by providing unprecedented, hourly resolution data from space. Combined with ground-based sensors (like Pandora, OpenAQ) and weather data, these datasets allow for actionable, hyperlocal air quality forecasts that empower communities and protect public health.

Outdoor air pollution is a leading global health risk, contributing to millions of deaths annually (WHO). Vulnerable groups‚Äîincluding children, the elderly, and people in industrial or fire-prone areas‚Äîare especially at risk. Our app is designed to help individuals, families, and communities limit exposure by making complex air quality and weather data simple, accessible, and actionable.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Integrated Data Sources:** Combines real-time weather (OpenWeatherMap), air quality (NASA's TEMPO, OpenAQ‚Äîsimulated in this prototype), and satellite-based insights.
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Calculates a dynamic "activity score" (0‚Äì100) based on weather, air quality, user activity, and physical condition‚Äîfor truly user-centric health advice.
- **Voice Assistant:** 
  - **Speech-to-Text:** Ask ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the air quality like in New York?‚Äù with your voice.
  - **Text-to-Speech:** The app speaks back a detailed, friendly summary‚Äîtailored to your planned activity and health sensitivities.
- **Clear Visualizations:**
  - **Modern Dashboard:** See temperature, humidity, wind, pressure, and air quality at a glance.
  - **5-Day Forecast:** Daily weather outlooks and air quality trends.
  - **Proactive Alerts:** Warnings for thunderstorms, extreme heat/cold, poor air quality, and more.
- **User-Centric Design:** 
  - Designed for health-sensitive groups, outdoor enthusiasts, families, and public decision-makers.
  - Simple, accessible interface for all ages and backgrounds.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Built with Streamlit and JavaScript, ready for cloud or local deployment.

## üõ∞Ô∏è Data Integration & Novelty

AirMood is inspired by the challenge of merging **satellite**, **ground-based**, and **weather** data. In a production version, the app would:

- Fetch near real-time TEMPO data (e.g., NO‚ÇÇ, HCHO, ozone).
- Integrate ground-based measurements (Pandora, TolNet, OpenAQ).
- Cross-validate satellite and ground data for accuracy.
- Provide hyperlocal forecasts and historical trends.
- Visualize data with intuitive, user-friendly graphics.
- Alert users based on personalized thresholds and health risk factors.

*Note: This prototype simulates NASA air quality data but is architected to support live APIs (TEMPO, OpenAQ, etc.) as they become available.*

## üìä Example Use Cases

- **Sensitive Groups:** Parents or school staff get instant alerts if outdoor conditions are unsafe for children.
- **Outdoor Athletes:** Runners, cyclists, or coaches receive tailored recommendations factoring in ozone, particulates, and weather.
- **Policy Makers:** Visualize local air quality trends, compare satellite and ground data in real time, and download reports.
- **Wildfire Response:** Emergency teams see live pollutant levels and get notified of spikes due to smoke events.
- **General Public:** Anyone can check if it‚Äôs a good day to exercise, walk, or simply relax outside.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python
- **Frontend:** [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- **Data Visualization:** Pandas, Plotly
- **APIs:**
  - **OpenWeatherMap API:** Real-time weather and forecast data.
  - **NASA TEMPO API & OpenAQ (Simulated):** Air quality data.
- **Voice Assistant:** Web Speech API (JavaScript) for speech recognition and synthesis.
